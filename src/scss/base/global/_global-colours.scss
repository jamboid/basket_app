HOW TO USE COLOUR VARIABLES IN THIS SASS PROJECT
------------------------------------------------

There are a couple of options available to you:

================
1-STEP SYSTEM
================

1. Define your colour palette as a set of COLOUR-DESCRIPTIVE VARIABLES (e.g. $clrPaleBlue)
2. Use these COLOUR-DESCRIPTIVE VARIABLES directly, throughout the project's other .scss files

RESULT: Colours are presented in the code in a much more readable and meaningful format

BEST FOR: Projects with one theme


================
2-STEP SYSTEM
================

1. Define your colour palette as a set of COLOUR-DESCRIPTIVE VARIABLES (e.g. $clrPaleBlue)
2. Define a set of SEMANTIC-STRUCTURAL VARIABLES to use throughout your Sass files (e.g. $clrPageHeaderBackground)
3. Set the SEMANTIC VARIABLES using the COLOUR-DESCRIPTIVE VARIABLES in this file only

RESULT: Colours are managed in one location and colour changes will not require renaming variables throughout the set of Sass files

BEST FOR: Projects that involve multiple themes or skins
